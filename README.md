# Introduction

A collection of projects that I worked on to showcase my Java programming skills by implementing object-oriented programming techniques. The goal of these projects is to apply data structures (Linked lists, arrays), inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation, polymorphism and abstract classes in useful Java applications.

## Requirements

- [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- Any Java IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.

## Contents

The projects are located in `src` as packages.

`BankAccountApplication` : An application that reads `.csv` files which contains bank related information of different people and uses a data structure to hold all these accounts. It also mimics a typical bank account by giving each account object properties such as checking and savings account.

`DatabaseApplication` : An application that manages student enrollment and payment. It lets any user add new student information such as name and grade level, and then their chosen courses and total tuition balance.

`EmailApplication` : An application for a company that creates email addresses for new hires with random passwords, methods to set/change passwords, alternate email, and mail box capacity.

## Usage

Download the `JavaProjects` zipped folder and unzip the contents to a location of your choosing.
